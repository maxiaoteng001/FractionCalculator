Part 1 - Fraction Class
    Create a new class called "Fraction"

Part 2 – FractionCalculator Class
    FractionCalculator class has a main method and three helper methods.

Part 3 - Putting it all together!

    1、Write a short introduction method that describes the calculator program
    and welcomes your user
    2、Ask the user to enter in an operation
    3、As long as the user enters something that’s not "q" or "Q" when asked for
    an operation you should run the calculator
    4、Get two fractions from the user and then perform whichever operation they
    ask for Print the result of the operation

Part 4 - Hacker Problem - FractionCalculatorAdvanced
    Create another class called FractionCalculatorAdvanced. You may cut and
    paste useful methods from FractionCalculator. The key difference between
    FractionCalculator and FractionCalculatorAdvanced is that the user can
    enter in their operations on a single line. Allow the user to enter their
    input onto a single line.
